# C17 Feature Support

C17 (ISO/IEC 9899:2018) was primarily a bug-fix release with no new language features. It clarified wording and fixed defects in C11.

## Changes from C11

- `__STDC_VERSION__` should be `201710L` for full C17 compliance
- Deprecated `gets()` function removed
- Various defect reports addressed

## Implementation Status

To claim C17 compliance, update `__STDC_VERSION__` to `201710L`. The compiler already supports all C17 requirements since they are a subset of C11.

**Current status:** Functionally complete (reports as C11)
