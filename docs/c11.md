# C11 Feature Support

## Implemented

- `_Generic` - Type-generic selection
- `_Alignas` / `_Alignof` - Alignment specifiers
- `_Atomic` - Atomic types and operations
- `_Thread_local` - Thread-local storage
- `_Noreturn` - Function specifier for non-returning functions
- `_Static_assert` - Compile-time assertions
- `_Bool` - Boolean type
- Anonymous structs/unions
- `u8` string literals (UTF-8)
- `__STDC_NO_*` feature test macros

## Not Implemented

### `_Complex` / `_Imaginary` - Complex number types
```c
double _Complex z = 1.0 + 2.0*I;
```
**Difficulty:** High - Requires new types, arithmetic operations, and math library support.

### Unicode string literals `u""` and `U""`
```c
char16_t *s16 = u"hello";
char32_t *s32 = U"hello";
```
**Difficulty:** Medium - Need to add lexer support for u/U prefixes and proper encoding.

### `char16_t` and `char32_t` types
Fixed-width character types for UTF-16 and UTF-32.
**Difficulty:** Medium - Types exist as macros but not as first-class types.

### `<threads.h>` support
C11 threading primitives (`thrd_create`, `mtx_lock`, etc.).
**Difficulty:** High - Requires runtime library implementation.

### Bounds-checking interfaces (Annex K)
Optional `*_s` functions like `strcpy_s`, `sprintf_s`.
**Difficulty:** Medium - Library implementation, not compiler feature.
